# NOTES

Decisions, spec-mismatch observations, and Aeneas surprises. Append; do not
rewrite history. Each entry says what was decided, what the evidence was, and
what would have to change to revisit it.

Written during Workstream 0 (the scaffold), so several entries are about the
build rather than about Hachi.

---

## Upstream aeneas, no fork

**Decision.** `hachi/lakefile.lean` requires `AeneasVerif/aeneas` at
`nightly-2026.07.26-3a8586f` — upstream, not a fork.

AeneasCompPoly, the repository this one is modelled on, requires a *fork* of
aeneas (`tobias-rothmann/aeneas @ lean-4.32.0`), and its README explains why:
CompPoly had moved to Lean v4.32.0, upstream aeneas's Lean backend hard-requires
Mathlib v4.31.0, and no upstream nightly had caught up. Copying that arrangement
here would have been the default, and it would have been wrong.

The specification this repository is proved against is **ArkLib**, and ArkLib is
on v4.31.0:

| | Lean / Mathlib |
|---|---|
| ArkLib `lean-toolchain`, `lake-manifest.json` | v4.31.0 |
| upstream aeneas `backends/lean/lakefile.lean` @ `nightly-2026.07.26-3a8586f` | v4.31.0 |

So the two agree already and the fork buys nothing. `AENEAS_TAG` in the `Makefile`
and the `require` in `hachi/lakefile.lean` are the same upstream commit, which is
the invariant `make setup` and `make extract` both check: `Generated.lean` is only
valid against the Aeneas version that produced it.

**To revisit:** if ArkLib bumps to v4.32.0, this flips to AeneasCompPoly's
situation and the fork (or a later upstream nightly) comes back. Move
`lean-toolchain`, the `aeneas` rev and `AENEAS_TAG` together.

## The cpoly dependency

**Decision.** The field layer stays a **cargo dependency** on AeneasCompPoly's
`cpoly` crate, pinned by `rev`. `field.rs` is *not* vendored. `make extract`
passes `--include 'cpoly::_'` to charon, and that flag is load-bearing.

The brief anticipated vendoring as the likely outcome ("if charon chokes on
cross-crate extraction, vendor the needed `field.rs` code"). Charon does not
choke, but it does need telling. Three extractions, in the order they were run:

**1. Plain `charon cargo --preset=aeneas -- --lib`.** Succeeds, and produces a
model that is worse than useless. Charon's default whitelist is the local crate,
so every `cpoly` item arrives as an axiom:

```lean
axiom cpoly.field.Fp : Type
axiom cpoly.field.Fp.ZERO : Result cpoly.field.Fp
axiom cpoly.field.Fp.Insts.CoreOpsArithAddFpFp.add
  : cpoly.field.Fp → cpoly.field.Fp → Result cpoly.field.Fp
```

An uninterpreted type with an uninterpreted addition. A Lean proof about a
function that sums such a thing proves nothing, and the three `axiom`s would
appear under every `#print axioms` in `lean/Check.lean` forever. Charon warns
about it — `The crate contains extracted external, unknown definitions` — but it
is a warning, and the build is green.

**2. `--extract-opaque-bodies` (the obvious first guess).** The flag's
description fits the symptom exactly: *"Usually we skip the bodies of foreign
methods and structs with private fields. When this flag is on, we don't."* `Fp` is
a struct with a private field. It is nonetheless the wrong tool, because it is
**global**: it also un-opaques `alloc::vec::Vec`, `alloc::raw_vec::RawVec` and the
rest of std, whose bodies Aeneas models by name rather than by translation. Aeneas
then fails outright:

```
Error: Detected groups of mixed mutually recursive definitions ...
Error: Mixed declaration groups ... are not supported yet: [7, 20, 17, 19, 18]
Error: Internal error: please file an issue
Warn : Could not translate type decl 'alloc::vec::Vec because of previous error
```

No Lean file is produced at all.

**3. `--include 'cpoly::_'`, with no `--extract-opaque-bodies`.** Correct. The
whitelist is *scoped*, so `cpoly` becomes transparent while std stays modelled.
Zero axioms, zero opaque definitions, and the bodies are real:

```lean
def cpoly.field.P : Std.U64 := 4294967197#u64
@[reducible] def cpoly.field.Fp := Std.U64
def cpoly.field.Fp.ZERO : cpoly.field.Fp := 0#u64
def cpoly.field.Fp.Insts.CoreOpsArithAddFpFp.add
  (self : cpoly.field.Fp) (rhs : cpoly.field.Fp) : Result cpoly.field.Fp := do
  let i ← self + rhs
  let i1 ← i % cpoly.field.P
  ok i1
```

`Ext4` — the case a one-field newtype does not cover, being a foreign struct with
four private fields — comes through as a real `structure` with real projections,
and its sixteen-term `mul` as a real definition. `lean/Check.lean` § 2 asserts all
of this, so dropping the flag breaks the build rather than quietly re-axiomatizing
the field.

**Why `rev` rather than a branch.** Not for build reproducibility — `Cargo.lock`
gives that — but for the frozen bench baseline. `benches/genesis/` is append-only
and must never change behaviour or speed once frozen; a field layer that could
move under it would break that guarantee silently. Bumping the rev is a
deliberate act with a re-baseline attached.

**To revisit:** if a later `cpoly` bump makes charon's whitelist insufficient (a
generic item, a `dyn Trait`, an inline-assembly intrinsic), vendoring is still the
fallback and this entry is the reason it was not needed first.

## What the cpoly dependency does *not* buy: its Lean proofs

**Observation, and a cost to plan for.** The Rust reuse works (above). The *Lean*
reuse does not, and cannot today.

`cpoly/lean/Field.lean` proves its field operations equivalent to CompPoly's
`Hachi.ext4Params` / `CompPoly.Extension.Ext`. Those definitions live in
`CompPoly/Fields/Hachi.lean` and `CompPoly/Fields/Extension/`, which exist **only
after CompPoly's Lean v4.32.0 bump**. Checked at both pins:

| CompPoly revision | reached from | `Fields/Hachi.lean`, `Fields/Extension/` |
|---|---|---|
| `e95ba1b1` (v4.31.0) | ArkLib | absent |
| `c0fcf450` (v4.32.0) | AeneasCompPoly | present |

So the field theory cpoly proves against needs v4.32.0, while the Hachi
specification this repository targets needs v4.31.0, and one Lake package cannot
have both.

This is survivable because **ArkLib's Hachi specs do not depend on those files**.
The Hachi and `CyclotomicRing` trees import only `CompPoly.Multilinear.Basic`,
`CompPoly.Multivariate.Operations`, `CompPoly.Univariate.Linear` and
`CompPoly.Univariate.ToPoly.Impl` — all present at v4.31.0 — and reference
`Hachi.ext4Params`, `CompPoly.Hachi` and `Extension.Ext` nowhere at all. The
target specs are self-contained at v4.31.0.

The consequence is a real item of work rather than a blocker: the bridge from the
extracted `cpoly.field.Fp` (which *is* `Std.U64`) to the coefficient ring the
ArkLib specs use — the `Red` invariant and a `toK`-style map into `ZMod q` — has
to be re-derived in this repository. It is not large, but it is not free, and it
is not the same as importing cpoly's `Field.lean`.

**To revisit:** an ArkLib bump to v4.32.0 collapses this entry and the fork entry
into each other, and the field proofs become importable.

## Chosen parameters

**Observation.** The ArkLib specification is generic in **all four** of
`(q, α, b, digits)`, and pins none of them anywhere. Searched: no concrete
modulus, no concrete `α`, no concrete gadget base or digit count appears in
`Commitments/Functional/Hachi/` or `Data/Lattices/`, and neither does the Hachi
prime `4294967197` in any form. Every parameter relation travels as a hypothesis
(`Fact (Nat.Prime q)`, `1 < b`, `q ≤ b ^ digits`).

Hard rule 3 of this project is the opposite — concrete, not generic, all
parameters as `const`s in one `params.rs` — so the values are this repository's
choice and each equivalence proof will instantiate a generic statement at them.
`hachi/src/params.rs` records the provenance of each; the split is:

| | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `Q` | `2^32 - 99` | **Pinned** by `cpoly`'s `Fp`, whose proofs this builds on. Prime; `< 2^32` (the no-overflow argument); `≡ 1 mod 4` (so `Y^4 - 2` is irreducible) |
| `EXT_DEGREE`, `EXT_W` | `4`, `2` | **Pinned** by `cpoly`'s `Ext4` |
| `GADGET_BASE` | `2` | **Chosen**, constrained to `1 < b`. Binary gives the shortest digits |
| `GADGET_DIGITS` | `32` | **Chosen**, and forced given `b = 2`: `zmodDigitDecomposition` needs `q ≤ b^digits`, and `2^32 = 4294967296 ≥ 4294967197 = q` with 99 to spare — so 32 is enough and 31 is not |
| `RING_LOG_DEGREE` (`α`) | `6` | **Chosen**, unconstrained by the spec. Degree-64 ring, per the Greyhound/Hachi line of work |

`α = 6` is the one value here with no spec-side or dependency-side justification —
it is a performance and security parameter both, and it is the most likely of the
five to be revised once the concrete parameter set of [NOZ26] is fixed. It is
checked in two places (`tests/params_semantics.rs`, `lean/Check.lean` § 1 and § 3)
but nothing *derives* it.

**Open question for whoever has the paper to hand:** the brief's later
workstreams, which would name the concrete specs and presumably the parameter
set, were not included in the brief as received. `α`, and the commitment matrix
dimensions that are not in `params.rs` at all yet, need that input.

---

## Aeneas surprises

**A `<<` in a `const` extracts as a `Result`.** `pub const RING_DEGREE: usize = 1
<< RING_LOG_DEGREE` is the natural way to write the ring degree and keep it tied
to `α`. Aeneas models a shift as fallible, so it extracts as

```lean
def params.RING_DEGREE : Result Std.Usize := 1#usize <<< params.RING_LOG_DEGREE
```

and every Lean use of the constant would then have to bind it and discharge a
side condition that is plainly true. `params.rs` writes the literal `64` instead,
which extracts as `def params.RING_DEGREE : Std.Usize := 64#usize`, and the
relation to `RING_LOG_DEGREE` is checked rather than structural — in
`tests/params_semantics.rs` and again in `lean/Check.lean` § 1.

This is the same shape as AeneasCompPoly's `table_len` (`1usize << vars`), which
carries a `pow2_spec` side condition for exactly this reason. The difference is
that `table_len` is a runtime function where the condition is real, and
`RING_DEGREE` is a compile-time constant where it is noise.

---

## Deferred from Workstream 0, deliberately

Neither is a blocker; both are recorded so they are not mistaken for oversights.

**The bench harness's checkers.** AeneasCompPoly's `benches/harness.py` (~1100
lines) implements `check-genesis`, `check-candidate`, `coverage`, `stamp-genesis`
and the recentred `cand vs now` report, and the `Makefile` exposes them as
`bench-check` / `bench-stamp` / `ledger-check`. Every one of those operates on
`@genesis`-annotated functions and `bench_case!` invocations, and this repository
has neither yet: `benches/genesis/` and `benches/candidate/` are empty on purpose.

What *is* in place is the part that cannot be added retroactively: both baseline
crates exist as siblings with the same compilation path, the `candidate` feature
is wired, and `profile.bench` carries AeneasCompPoly's measured `lto = "fat"` /
`codegen-units = 1` settings. `make run-bench` runs criterion on the pinned
toolchain. The checkers land with the first real module, which is the first thing
they would have anything to say about.

The one irreversible rule is already being obeyed: **nothing is frozen into
`benches/genesis/` yet**, because the only function in the crate is a throwaway
extraction probe, and freezing a throwaway into an append-only baseline is the
single mistake in this harness that cannot be undone.

**`.claude/skills/` and `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.** AeneasCompPoly carries 39 skill files
and a catalogue describing them. They are not in Workstream 0's deliverable list,
and porting them verbatim would import ~40 documents that all reference CompPoly,
`cpoly`, and an optimization loop this repository does not yet have a corpus for —
stale on arrival. They should be ported when there is work for them to drive, and
adapted rather than copied.

---

## `hachi/src/smoke.rs` is temporary

It implements no part of the scheme. It exists so that the cross-crate extraction
question above could be answered with a measurement instead of a guess, and it is
written to touch exactly what the boundary has to carry: a foreign newtype, a
foreign associated constant, a foreign operator impl, a foreign multi-field
struct, and a `Vec` walked by an index-counter loop.

Delete it — with its bench case and its `Cargo.toml` bench target — when the first
real module lands. It must never be frozen into `benches/genesis/`.
