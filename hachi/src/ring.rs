//! The negacyclic ring `R_q = Z_q[X] / (X^N + 1)`, with `N = RING_DEGREE`.
//!
//! Reference specification: `ArkLib/Data/Lattices/CyclotomicRing/Rq.lean`,
//! instantiated at the Hachi modulus (`InnerOuter/Arithmetic.lean`'s
//! `hachiModulus q α = primePowTwoModulus q α`, i.e. `φ = X^{2^α} + 1`).
//!
//! # Representation, and how it lines up with the spec
//!
//! ArkLib's `Rq Φ` is a *subtype*: `{ p : CPolynomial R // Φ.reduce p = p }`,
//! the computable polynomials already fixed by reduction mod `φ`. It is a
//! subtype rather than a raw polynomial for a reason that matters to the
//! commitment's soundness -- two raw polynomials can be unequal yet congruent
//! mod `φ`, which would make the binding reduction unsound (`Rq.lean:14-17`).
//!
//! Here that subtype is a coefficient vector of *exactly* [`params::RING_DEGREE`]
//! elements, little-endian in `X`: `Rq::from_coeffs(vec![a, b])` is `a + b·X`.
//! The two presentations agree because `deg φ = N`, so "fixed by reduction" and
//! "has fewer than `N` coefficients" are the same condition -- ArkLib proves
//! exactly this in `reduce_eq_self_of_degree_lt` and
//! `natDegree_lt_of_reduced`. Fixing the length at `N` (rather than trimming
//! trailing zeros, as `CPolynomial` does) is what makes every operation below a
//! straight loop with no reduction step: the spec's `add_val` / `sub_val` /
//! `neg_val` prove that reduction is a no-op on those, and `mul` folds the
//! wraparound in as it goes.
//!
//! # The length invariant
//!
//! The `N`-coefficient shape is an invariant of construction, not a checked
//! precondition: every constructor here produces exactly `N` coefficients and
//! every operation preserves that. The operations index up to `N`, so a
//! hand-built shorter vector would panic -- which is why the Lean side carries
//! it as a hypothesis (`Wf a : a.length = N`) on each `_spec`, the way `cpoly`'s
//! `Field.lean` carries `Red` for the reducedness of an `Fp` word. Aeneas cannot
//! see a Rust privacy boundary, so the invariant has to be said out loud there
//! even though nothing outside this module can break it.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No NTT. The product below is the schoolbook `O(N²)` convolution, which is
//! what the specification's `mul` is; an NTT is a later, bench-driven
//! optimization and carries an equivalence obligation of its own.
